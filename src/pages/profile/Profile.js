                <p>Hi! My name is Sachita Kashyap and I am a junior at Monta Vista High School. At school, I currently play on the Field Hockey Team and I am an officer for the MV App and Web Development Club. In my free time, I love to dance Classical Indian Dance which I have been learning for the last nine years, take polaroid pictures and photography, and paint with acrylic on canvas. One of my favorite memories from dance includes competing at the Grand Prix Italia in Barcelona in the summer of 2018. My career interests explore the intersections between computer science, business, and using art through marketing and design. I'm interested in pursuing business-oriented and web design degrees. Thanks for visiting my website! If you're interested in messaging me directly, head over to the Contact Me page.</p>

                    <p>This course is the follow up course to Intro to Engineering Design which I took Sophomore year. Through this class, I learnt many valuable skills like AutoDesk Inventor which is a tool to CAD automata pieces like pulleys, screws, and . We also learnt about the design process and worked in groups to simulate a real world engineering environment.</p>

My project was the "Efficiency of the bacteria Lactobacillus Acidophilus and fermented milk in repopulating the microbiome post-antibiotic regimen". I collected my data by growing bacteria cultures and performing statistical tests on them, and presented my findings at the Synopsis Science Fair.</p>
